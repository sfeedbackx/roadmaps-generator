# What we want not technical

We want our Ai  to give him some tool to goes and search web and scrap some sites related to the
topic that user want to learn and we try to find the optimal RM based on his skill (and most
likely we are going to take other input witch the duration  that user want to learn for example
user want to learn the topic x in 3 month with the skills a,b,c..) we return the RM in a good
form (still figuring out what from should the ai return ) that it .
